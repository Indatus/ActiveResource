# v2 active-resource todo list

* Add **IoC Container** w/ illuminate/container & resolve classes from there
* Perhaps add interface + **repository** + class for remote comms (guzzle)
* Refactor ActiveResource class using other classes / interfaces with **single-responsibility** (re: aa-41)
* Add **Facade** pattern to get rid of static properties / methods
* Add **illuminate/config** to have built-in config files vs base class requirements
* Add **illuminate/support** for ServiceProvider usage
